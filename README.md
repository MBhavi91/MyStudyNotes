# Roadmap to Become a Full Stack Software Engineer

When I decided to re-enter the industry as a full-stack software engineer after a one-year break, I felt completely lost. I had no idea where to begin. There were countless articles on what to learn as a frontend developer, backend developer, or even about system architecture, but none of them provided a comprehensive, structured guide in one place.

After extensive research, I decided to start with HTML, as it forms the foundation of web development. To keep myself organized, I created a rough roadmap. However, I was fortunate to come across a website called [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) one night while mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. This website turned out to be an invaluable resource, offering a clear learning path for various technologies. It also provided a wealth of project ideas for hands-on practice. While I will include as many of these as possible here, I highly recommend visiting the website for additional insights, assuming it remains available.

You might wonder why I am creating a GitHub page if such a website already exists. In today's digital landscape, nothing is guaranteed to last foreverâ€”websites can go offline at any time. Therefore, I wanted to document my own personalized roadmap, tailored to my learning needs.

Below is a comprehensive roadmap to becoming a full-stack software engineer. To avoid overwhelming information, I have categorized it systematically. The roadmap provides an overview of the full-stack development journey, followed by a detailed breakdown of each aspect.
