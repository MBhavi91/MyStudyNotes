## Introduction to CSS

### What is CSS?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

### How CSS works with HTML.

CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

1. Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.

```
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>
```

2. Internal - by using a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <style>
            body {background-color: powderblue;}
            h1   {color: blue;}
            p    {color: red;}
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

3. External - by using a `<link>` element to link to an external CSS file.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

```
styles.css - file

body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}
```
