# API Performance Best Practices

API Performance Best Practices refers to a set of recommended techniques and strategies used to make your APIs faster, more efficient, and scalable.

## Caching

- Utilize caching mechanisms (HTTP, Server/Client, CDN).
- Use cache aside, write-through, or read-through caching patterns based on your application requirements.
- Implement caching at various levels such as database query results, HTML fragments, or even full-page caching.
- Use proper cache-invalidation strategies to ensure data consistency and prevent stale content issues.

## Optimize API Response

- Enforce reasonable payload size limits.
- Enable compression for responses.
- Implement e!cient pagination for large datasets.
- Minimise unnecessary processing or expensive computation on the server.

## Databases

- Use connection pooling to reduce connection overhead.
- Fine-tune connection pool settings (e.g. max connections idle timeout, connection reuse params) to optimize resource utilization and prevent connection exhaustion.
- Create e!cient database indexes.
- Keep an eye on and fine-tune ORM queries.
- Utilize features such as lazy loading, eager loading, and batch processing to optimize data retrieval.
- Implement e!cient pagination for large datasets.
- Avoid SELECT \* queries and fetch only required columns.
- Consider denormalizing database schema for ready-heavy workloads and reduce JOIN operations.
- Optimize JOIN operations and avoid unnecessary joins.
- Regularly clean up unused data and perform database maintenance tasks like vacuuming, indexing, and optimizing queries.
- Enable slow-query logging and keep an eye on that.
- Set up database replication for redundancy and improved read performance.
- Use DB sharding for data distribution if required.
- Use profiling tools o"ered by your database.

## Asynchronism

- Offload heavy tasks to background jobs or queues.
- Utilize message brokers for async communication between services.

## Load Balancing & Scaling

- Use Horizontal or Vertical scaling whatever appropriate.
- Use load balancing to distribute tra!c across servers.

## Code Optimization

- Implement streaming of large requests/responses.
- Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Optimize algorithms and data structures used
- Identify and optimize critical paths or frequently accessed endpoints for overall system health.
- Consider using compiled languages like Go or Rust for performance-critical parts of your backend.
- Look into di"erent architectural styles (SOA, Micro services) and decompose services if required.
- Set appropriate connection timeouts and implement e!cient retry mechanism to handle network issues.
- Batch similar requests together to minimize overhead and reduce the number of round trips.

## Security

- Keep your dependencies up to date.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized access.
- Implement request throttling and rate limiting.
- Regularly audit and update security measures.

## Monitoring and Logging

- Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track performance metrics and troubleshoot issues.
- Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack.
- Use asynchronous logging mechanisms to minimise the logging overhead.

## Performance Testing

- Conduct regular performance testing and benchmarking to identify performance regressions, track improvements, and fine-tune optimization e"orts over time.

## Network

- Minimize network latency by hosting your backend close to your users.
- Utilize HTTP keep-alive to reduce connection overhead.
- Use CDNs for static and frequently accessed assets.
- Prefetch or preload resources, data, or dependencies required for subsequent requests to minimise latency
