## 1. Foundations of System Design & Fundamentals

### What is System Design?

**System Design** is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It is a high-level approach used in both software and hardware domains, but it's especially critical in software engineering when building large, scalable, and complex systems like web applications, cloud services, or distributed systems.

System design bridges the gap between a conceptual idea and a practical, functioning system. It is both a creative and analytical discipline, combining problem-solving, engineering principles, and architectural patterns.

It involves making decisions about:

- **What** components the system will have
- **How** those components will interact.
- **Where** data will be stored and processed.
- **How** users or other systems will interact with it.

This process ensures the system fulfills **both functional requirements** (what the system should do) and **non-functional requirements** (performance, scalability, security, etc.).

### Goals of System Design

The primary goals of system design are to:

- **Define architecture:** Determine how different parts of the system will interact.
- **Ensure scalability:** The system should handle increasing loads efficiently.
- **Achieve reliability:** The system should function correctly under expected and unexpected conditions.
- **Maintainability:** Systems should be easy to modify, update, or debug.
- **Efficiency:** Optimal use of resources such as memory, CPU, and bandwidth.
- **Security:** Safeguarding data and preventing unauthorized access.
- **User-centric design:** Ensuring good user experience and usability.

### Importance of System Design

System design is crucial for several reasons:

- **Foundation of Software Development:** A well-thought-out design reduces errors and improves the quality of the final product.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Good design anticipates future growth and changes.
- **Team Collaboration:** Provides a shared understanding and blueprint for all stakeholders.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Early detection of flaws through design saves time and development costs.
- **Performance Optimization:** It helps identify potential bottlenecks and address them during the design phase.

### Types of System Design

1. **High-Level Design (HLD):**

   - Focuses on system architecture
   - Identifies modules, data flow, and technologies
   - Defines how components interact

2. **Low-Level Design (LLD):**

   - Detailed internal logic of components
   - Class diagrams, method signatures, database schemas
   - Often used by developers for implementation

### Key Components of System Design

1. **Scalability**
   - Can the system handle increased load?
   - Horizontal scaling (more machines) vs. vertical scaling (more power to a machine)
2. **Performance**
   - Latency: Time taken to respond.
   - Throughput: Requests handled per second.
3. **Availability**
   - How often is the system up and running?
   - 99.9% (three 9s) = 8.76 hours downtime/year
4. **Reliability**
   - Can the system work correctly even with failures?
   - Redundancy, failover mechanisms, backups
5. **Maintainability**
   - How easy is it to modify, update, or fix the system?
6. **Security**
   - Protecting data and services from unauthorized access
7. **Consistency**
   - Ensuring data remains accurate across distributed systems (CAP theorem comes into play here)

System design is not just about drawing boxes and arrows—it's about creating systems that are **robust, scalable, secure, and efficient.** Whether you’re building a small feature or architecting an entire platform, system design is a **critical skill** that shapes how software functions in the real world.

### Types of Design

#### High-Level Design (HLD)

High-Level Design (HLD) outlines the **system architecture** — how the components interact, what technologies are used, and how the system is structured.

It's like the **blueprint of a house** before it's built: rooms, floors, plumbing lines — but not down to the color of the walls.

**Goals of HLD**

- Define **scope** of the system
- Visualize **system architecture**
- Identify **modules, services, and interactions**
- Choose **technology stack**
- Show **data flow and control flow**
- Support **non-functional requirements:** scalability, performance, availability, etc.

**Key Components of HLD**

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

#### Low-Level Design (LLD)

Low-Level Design (LLD) zooms in on the **implementation details** of each component. It defines **classes, methods, data structures, algorithms, database schema**, and how everything is built internally.

It’s like the **interior design of your house:** wall colors, furniture layout, plumbing details.

**Goals of LLD**

- Break HLD components into **concrete class structures**
- Design **business logic**, workflows, and algorithms
- Define **method signatures** and data flow between functions
- Ensure **code-level consistency** and reusability
- Identify **bottlenecks** and optimize for efficiency

**Key Components of LLD**

def **init**(self):
self.short_to_long = {}
self.long_to_short = {}

    def shorten(self, long_url: str) -> str:
        # Logic to shorten and store
        ...

    def expand(self, short_url: str) -> str:
        # Logic to retrieve original
        ...
```

- **Database Table:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE url_map (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
short_url VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
long_url TEXT,
created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

- **Algorithm:**
  - Base62 encoding
  - Hashing + collision check
  - Expiry cleanup logic
